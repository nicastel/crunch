crunch
======

GitHub clone of SVN repo http://crunch.googlecode.com/svn/ (cloned by http://svn2github.com/)

Fork of the awesome crunch library https://code.google.com/p/crunch/

The purpose of this fork is to improve integration of crunch into GDAL (http://www.gdal.org/) and Mapserver http://mapserver.org

There is already a DDS driver available (http://www.gdal.org/frmt_various.html#DDS) in GDAL that use crunch but some improvement can be made.
